## Notes

This is my first time working on XCode for IOS App using Swift language. So at the begainning I did faced some stuggle to start with it but I am glad I was able to overcome it and successfully builded my first IOS App.

- I would like to create an app designed to help users manage stress and practice mindfulness throughout their day. The app features short, guided meditation sessions ranging from 2 to 10 minutes that can be customized for specific needs, such as anxiety, focus, or relaxation. A key feature is the "Pause Reminder", which sends gentle notifications throughout the day, prompting users to take a moment to breathe and reset, even during busy times. Additionally, users can track their emotional well-being through a daily mood log and get recommendations for exercises based on their feelings. The app also includes a community board where users can share tips, progress, or simply support each other in their mindfulness journey.
